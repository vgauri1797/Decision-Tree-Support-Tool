# Decision-Tree-Support-Tool
Developed a decision support tool that constructs decision trees from a custom file format representing decisions, lotteries, and outcomes. The system loads a decision file, generates a graph-based internal structure, calculates expected values for lotteries, identifies optimal actions at decision nodes and outputs the full tree.
